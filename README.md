# Hyperparameter Tuning for Breast Cancer Classification

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates hyperparameter tuning on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify breast cancer as malignant or benign. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset is used for this purpose.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features computed from breast cancer cell images, and the target variable indicates whether the cancer is malignant or benign.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Load and Preprocess the Data**: Loading the dataset, splitting into training and testing sets, and standardizing the features.
2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Using grid search to find the optimal set of hyperparameters for the SVM model.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the best model using classification metrics.


## Results
The best parameters found through grid search improved the model's performance, achieving higher accuracy in classifying breast cancer.

## Conclusion
Hyperparameter tuning is a vital step in optimizing machine learning models. This project highlights its importance and demonstrates the process using an SVM model for breast cancer classification.
